## Intro
A GUI Offline Tool for decrypting and manipulating *.md files used by [**repique**](https://github.com/AZ-X/pique) and dnscrypt proxy

It's targeted for creating your own DoT, DoH and DNSCrypt resolver list at the beginning.

It was a less than three days project from very beginning.

Everything looks good ~~except GUI~~ including fancy GUI.

At least, it works great.

Wiki pages will be created for guidance.

# Goals

 - Afford an opportunity to go through obscure details of default resolvers and relays bundled into various dnscrypt proxy      
   configurations which source is maintained by [https://dnscrypt.info](https://dnscrypt.info).
 - Produce a compatible md file as a tiny selection or recreation of different sources representative and on your own.
 - Verify the signature of present md file.
