## Intro
A GUI Offline Tool for decrypting and manipulating *.md files used by dnscrypt proxy

It's a less than three days project from very beginning.

Everything looks good ~~except GUI~~ including fancy GUI.

At least, it works great.

Wiki pages will be created for guidance.

# Goals

 - Afford an opportunity to go through obscure details of default resolvers and replies bundled into various dnscrypt proxy      
   configurations which source is maintained by [https://dnscrypt.info](https://dnscrypt.info).
 - Produce a compatible md file as a tiny selection or recreation of different sources representative and on your own.
 - Verify the signature of present md file.
